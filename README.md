# Betsy Groton's Portfolio Site :honeybee:

## About

In case you've gotten to this point and you don't know, I'm Betsy and I'm a software engineer :satisfied: This is a portfolio of all my projects!

I built this little site from scratch and used babel, webpack, HTML/CSS, styled components, and React. It's deployed on Netlify. There are a few things I'd like to add including but not limited to responsive design/mobile compatible design, migrate to TypeScript, testing, improving the styling, adding a career timeline, and adding a visually appealing list of the tech stack I'm familiar with.
