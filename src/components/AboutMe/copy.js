  "Hello! My name is Betsy and I'm a full stack software engineer. I'm originally from Westwood, MA and I studied Mass Communications at Miami University of Ohio (NOT Florida). During my senior year, my mom lost her battle with cancer, and it made me think a lot about how I wanted to spend my time here. I decided I wanted to spend my time helping others and giving people more opportunities, so I decided to join Teach for America.  I taught for two years in a rural community outside Cleveland, Mississippi, then continued teaching for five more years in Brooklyn, New York. Teaching ignited my passion for leadership, educational equity, and social justice. I also learned how to motivate, inspire, and effectively communicate with others.";
